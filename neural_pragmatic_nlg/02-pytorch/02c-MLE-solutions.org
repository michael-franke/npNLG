> 1. Change the true mean (`trueLocation`) to 10e6. Is training still successful?  What would you change?
> *Answer*: increase `nTrainingSteps`
>
> 2. Revert to initial conditions. Change the initial value of the parameter `location` to -10e6. Does training work? What's the problem? How would you fix it?
> *Answer*: increase `nTrainingSteps`
>
> 3. Revert to initial conditions. Rerun the script with only 100 samples (using variable `nObs`). Does the training work? What's the problem? How would you fix it without increasing `nTrainingSteps`?
> *Answer*: increase `learningRate`
