* Basics of PyTorch

PyTorch is a high-level framework for machine learning based on [[http://torch.ch/][torch]].
Modern ML techniques, such as artificial neural networks, require efficient computations of algebraic operations on large and high-dimensional tensors.
PyTorch offers a tensor-based computing framework that is optimized for exactly these kinds of computations.
Moreover, PyTorch offers ready-made modules for building complex ANNs.
A powerful automatic differentiation system, makes training these networks possible.

There are other similar libraries on the market (e.g., tensorflow), but PyTorch has been particularly popular in the NLP community.
