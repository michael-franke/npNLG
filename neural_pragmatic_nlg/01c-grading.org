* Grading

There are two things necessary for course completion:

1. homework exercises
2. final course project

The final grade is calculated as 0.4 * grade-homework + 0.6 * grade-project.

** Homework exercises

There will be (ususally: weekly) homework exercises.
Everybody must hand these in individually.
*Cooperation is discouraged at this point.*
You need to have at least a passing grade to be allowed to take part in the final course projects.

** Final course projects

You will be working in a small group on a final course project.
The modal project is a replication and critical assessment of a research paper.
A list of topic suggestions will be made available.
