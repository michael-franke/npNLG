* Recurrent neural networks

In this session we learn about recurrent neural networks.


** Learning goals for this session
1. become familiar with language modeling
   1. causal (left-to-right) models
   2. training, prediction, evaluation
2. meet a first neural LM: recurrent neural networks

** Slides

Here are the slides for this session.

** Practical exercises

There is one notebook with hands-on exercises for RNNs.
