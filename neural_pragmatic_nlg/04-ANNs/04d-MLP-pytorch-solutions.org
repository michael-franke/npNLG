> 1. Guess how the weights of the slope matrices are initialized (roughly). Same for the intercept vectors.
>
> *Solution:* The values seems scattered around 0, but can sometimes also be a bit farther away. Hunch: normal distribution around 0. (That's indeed how they are in fact initialized).

>
> 1. Above we used the DataLoader to train in 4 mini-batches. Change it so that there is only one batch containing all the data. Change the `shuffle` parameter so that data is not shuffled. Run the model and check if you observe any notable differences. Explain what your observations. (If you do not see anything, explain why you don't. You might pay attention to the results of training)
>
> *Solution:* With four mini-batches the training is less efficient. This is because the training signal that is backpropagated through the network based on just 25 observations is really rather weak.
