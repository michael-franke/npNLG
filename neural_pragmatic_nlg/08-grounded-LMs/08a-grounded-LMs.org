* Grounded Language Models

A grounded language model is a language model that generates language for some meaningful representation like a table, an image or a video.
We will focus on image captioning, i.e., models that produce a text-based description of an image, a so-called /image caption/.

We will visit a neural image captioner written from scratch, and also consult ways of fine-tuning pre-trained large image processing models and language models for image captioning.

** Learning goals for this session

1. understand basic architectures for grounded LMs (with a focus on neural image captioning)
2. critically assess research papers on (grounded) LMs
3. interpret and apply common evaluation metrics

** Slides

Here are the [slides for this session]([[https://michael-franke.github.io/npNLG/08-grounded-LMs.pdf]]).
