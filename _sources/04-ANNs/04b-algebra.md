# Linear algebra

Artificial neural networks are efficiently implemented as tensors.
In written communication, they are also usually defined in terms of vector and matrix operations.
This [cheat sheet](<https://michael-franke.github.io/npNLG/04-algebra.pdf>) cheat sheet contains the most essential concepts and notation used in this course.
